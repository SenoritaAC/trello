### Installation

This Power-up is currently **under review** by Trello, but will hopefully be publicly available before September 2017. If you want to be notified when it's done, feel free to sign up [there](http://eepurl.com/cWtVi1).

In the mean time, you can **test it from a public sample board**, by following the instructions below.

### Want to test this Power-up?

I can definitely use your help to improve the quality of this power-up!

Just follow these instructions:

1. join the [test board](https://trello.com/invite/b/C1BeGLFW/755950e252ae81aeb6c899187fab1be2/trello-outliner-tests-latest)
2. open the "[test](https://trello.com/c/ERiqMB1L/1-test-card)" card and write a random comment
3. click the **outline a comment** button (on the right)
4. after authorising the power-up, select your comment from the list => a new tab will open
5. make some changes in your comment, then click on **save**
6. go back to the test card (initial tab) and make sure that your comment is up to date

**If it's not**, please go back to the tab that was opened at step 4, open your JavaScript console (press `cmd-alt-J`, `ctrl-shift-J`, or `F12`) then [send me a copy](https://github.com/adrienjoly/trello-outliner/issues/new) of the whole contents of the console, to help me understand what went wrong and fix it.

Thank you in advance for your help! ðŸ™Œ 

### Want to test this Power-up on your own board?

Follow these instructions:

1. Go to [https://trello.com/power-ups/admin](https://trello.com/power-ups/admin)
2. Pick the team with which you'd like to test Trello Outliner (you can create your own, with only yourself inside)
3. Click on *Create New Power-Up*
4. In the *Power-Up Name* field, type `Outliner (test)`
5. In the *Manifest URL* field, type `https://trello-outliner-github.glitch.me/manifest.json`
6. Then, press *Save*.
7. Go to one of your Trello boards that belong to the team you had picked in step 2
8. Open a card that contains at least one comment (or create one)
9. Click the *Outline* button on the right of the card, in the Power-ups section
10. Click the comment that you'd like to edit => it should open a new tab that allows you to edit that comment (without Markdown formatting, for now)
11. In that tab, make a simple change (e.g. add some text), then press *Save*
12. Back to your Trello tab, the comment should have been updated.

If you notice any problem, please contact me at adrien.joly (@) gmail.com, and tell me what step fails, and how.
