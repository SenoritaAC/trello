## Inspiration

Outliners are a great way to structure our ideas and findings into hierarchical notebooks. Trello comments are great to keep a living history of each card, and Markdown formatting makes it possible to give some structure to those notes. What if we could have the benefits of outliners while editing Trello comments?

## What it does

It allows to edit any Trello comment using a outliner, instead of Trello's built-in markdown editor.

This gives several benefits:

- Increased focus while editing a comment, because the editor shows up in a separate browser tab, allowing to close the Trello board's tab (to avoid distractions)
- Manipulate the structure of bullet points and sub-bullet points easily, using the TAB key and drag&drop gestures
- Bonus: Never lose information again by forgetting to save, or accidentally cancelling your changes, thanks to auto-save.
- Bonus: WYSIWYG (*what you see is what you get*) Markdown editing

## How I built it

I used glitch.com and the "Card Snoozer" example provided by Trello as a starting point, then incrementally added my own features, starting with the core ones: listing comments, loading a comment, and saving a comment from another browser tab.

## Challenges I ran into

So far, so good!

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

I had already made an add-on for Trello, but it was made as an extension for Google Chrome. This is the first time that I develop a proper Trello Power-up!

## What I learned

Glitch is a very efficient (and cool) way to develop a power-up for Trello!

## What's next for Trello Outliner

So far, the comment editing works. Now I need to add the outliner functionalities!
